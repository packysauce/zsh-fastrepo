# zsh-fastrepo
A slightly faster hg/git bookmark/branch getter that makes me sane in enormous repos

# install
I've only used oh-my-zsh so that's how this is laid out

Just git clone this into your $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins directory and add it to your plugin list in .zshrc

  git clone https://github.com/packysauce/zsh-fastrepo.git "$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins"

should do the trick

# please help
I suck at zsh, so I'm all ears if you have PRs or suggestions
